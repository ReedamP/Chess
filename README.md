# Chess
This was my first project so the code will not be as efficient as my other projects!

Pyhton 2.6 and up is required for this to work.

Furthermore, Pygame 1.9.1 and more recent releases is also required to be downloaded and installed on the system. All files present are also required to be on the same directory. Other IDEs can be used to run this game however make sure there is a python debugger present.

However, it is highly recommended to just use the normal Python IDE to run this game (as no additional downloads are required!).

How to run the program:
1.	Download and install Python first for your OS https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and then Pygame https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads/.
/// Please make sure the version of Pygame is compatible with the version of Python installed. I used Python 3.4.4 with Pygame 1.9.2 so it is highly recommended to use that if you are using Windows. ///
2.	If the Pygame folder is not automatically installed in the Python directory for your version, then locate and place the downloaded Pygame folder in the "include" folder inside your Python directory (C:/Pythonxx/include/ ) with xx being your Python's version.
3.	Download and extract the Chess of Thrones file.
4.	Click on the "ChessOfThrones" file to play.
